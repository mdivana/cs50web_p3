# CS50web Project 3 Mail
#### Description:
This web app is created for CS50web
Project has 2 different folders: mail and project3

Mail folder is where web app functionality is. 

This web app is simplified version of Mail app which works with vanilla JS to make the web app based
on API routes for better performance.

Since distribution code was given with everything written in Python, I only had to implement functions 
in index.js file, I edited load_mailbox function and implemented send_mail and view_mail functions.
